# Question11
Copying other people’s work to me means that one does not understand the subject or task given. 
It also means that they don’t want to. 
A person who wants to make things work, goes the extra mile if need arises. 
Also, submitting another person’s work as your own not only gets them into trouble too but it also doesn’t give the pioneer the credits they deserve for the hard work and dedication they put to make the project worthy. 
When one understands something fully, it is very rare they forget it in their lives. 
So, it is important to take time (but not much) to understand and be able answer questions on the given subject or task, no matter which angle those questions come from.
Again, I feel that fully understanding a topic allows one to be interested in other related topics, which could not be a bad idea.
